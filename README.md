# FlowchartConverter
FlowchartConverter is a WinForms application that helps users create programs using simple flowcharts.

Depending on the programming language, this can be either easy or quite difficult for a beginning programmer. Many languages require to write lines upon lines of confusing code just to get it to display "Hello, world!".

However, using FlowchartConverter, users can use shapes to represent the different actions that users want their program to perform. So, programmers can concentrate on the algorithm rather than all the nuances and details of a typical programming language.
FlowchartConverter can convert flowcharts to the most two popular languages (C++ and C#)

### Prerequisites:
The application was built on [.NET framework 4.5.2](https://www.microsoft.com/en-eg/download/details.aspx?id=42642) and written using C# programming language.

### Features:
1. Interactively generate code:
	- The Source Code Viewer can convert your flowchart to two popular programming languages.
2. Code compilation and execution.
3. Language features:
	- Single dimensional arrays
	- Pre-test (while) and Post-test (do while) loops
	- For loops
	- Explicit variable declaration. Flowcharts generally use implicit declaration (given they are quite minimalistic).
4. Utilities:
	- Flowcharts can be exported to JPG image.
	- Programs can be saved and loaded using XML.


### Shapes:
- Assignment
- Declare
- Do
- For
- If
- If Else
- Input
- Output
- While


### Built With:
- [Open Diagram](https://opendiagram.codeplex.com/): Open Diagram is the definitive open source .net diagramming component library for the .Net framework winforms environment.
